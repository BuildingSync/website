Each release of the schema includes several supporting documents, the Schema, a Data Dictionary, List of Measures. More information regarding each of the supporting documents is described below and the various versions of schemas are found [here](../schema).

#### [Schema](../schema)
The BuildingSync schema can be used to create and validate XML files. There have been multiple releases of the schema and they can be found [here](../schema).

#### BuildingSync On-boarding Document
The BuildingSync team has created a document to help new users get started with BuildingSync. The focus of this document is to guide the user in the development of a clear use case for BuildingSync, creating a Schematon instance, and uploading to the BuildingSync Selection Tool. The document can be downloaded [here](BuildingSync-on-boarding.pdf)

#### Data Dictionary
The data field "dictionary" includes field names, definitions, units, and other attributes for the enumerated fields. The data dictionary is aligned with BEDES, but includes only the subset of data fields that are relevant for energy audits. This page can be referenced to help standardize the terminology used in energy audits, but it does not provide a structure that allows data to be exchanged across different applications.

#### List of Measures
The list of measures defined in the BuildingSync Schema 
contain a TechnologyCategory and a list of valid enumerations. 

### Other Supporting Documents

There are several supporting documents that are independent of the version of the schema. The supporting documents include Example Files, a Geometry Reference Sheet, and an Implementation Guide. More information can be found below.

#### [Example Files](https://github.com/BuildingSync/schema/tree/develop/examples)
These [example files](https://github.com/BuildingSync/schema/tree/develop/examples) aid in applying the schema to a particular energy auditing software. This collection is not exhaustive, but should still be helpful.

#### [Geometry Reference Sheet](https://github.com/BuildingSync/schema/blob/develop/docs/Geometry%20Reference.pdf)
The BuildingSync [Geometry Reference Sheet](https://github.com/BuildingSync/schema/blob/develop/docs/Geometry%20Reference.pdf) 
illustrates how most of the simplified geometric terms (shapes, side names, vertices, orientations) are defined in the context of BuildingSync.

#### [Implementation Guide](BuildingSync%20v1.0-legacy%20Implementation%20Guide.pdf)
The [Implementation Guide](BuildingSync%20v1.0-legacy%20Implementation%20Guide.pdf) is a comprehensive guide illustrating the process needed to adopt the BuildingSync schema. The Guide also provides context for BuildingSync and discusses how it has been developed in close coordination with 
the energy auditing industry.
