The first three documents (Data Dictionary, Geometry Reference Sheet) 
comprise BuildingSyncÂ®, and the fourth (Implementation Guide) is a 
comprehensive guide to using it and implementing it with energy auditing 
software.

#### [Data Dictionary](data-dictionary)
The [data field "dictionary"](data-dictionary) includes field names, 
definitions, units, and other attributes for the enumerated fields.
The data dictionary is aligned with BEDES, but includes only
the subset of data fields that are relevant for energy audits. This page 
can be referenced to help standardize the terminology used in energy 
audits, but it does not provide a structure that allows data to be 
exchanged across different applications.

#### [Measures](measures)
The list of [Measures](measures) defined in the BuildingSync Schema 
contain a TechnologyCategory and a list of valid enumerations. 

#### [Example Files](https://github.com/BuildingSync/schema/tree/develop/examples)
These [example files](https://github.com/BuildingSync/schema/tree/develop/examples) 
aid in applying the schema to a particular energy auditing software. 
This collection is not exhaustive, but should still be helpful.

#### [Geometry Reference Sheet](https://github.com/BuildingSync/schema/blob/develop/docs/Geometry%20Reference.pdf)
The BuildingSync [Geometry Reference Sheet](https://github.com/BuildingSync/schema/blob/develop/docs/Geometry%20Reference.pdf) 
illustrates how most of the simplified geometric terms (shapes, side 
names, vertices, orientations) are defined in the context of 
BuildingSync.

#### [Implementation Guide](BuildingSync%20v1.0-legacy%20Implementation%20Guide.pdf)
The [Implementation Guide](BuildingSync%20v1.0-legacy%20Implementation%20Guide.pdf) 
is a comprehensive guide illustrating the process needed to adopt the 
BuildingSync schema. The Guide also provides context for BuildingSync 
and discusses how it has been developed in close coordination with 
the energy auditing industry.

#### [Schema](schema)
The BuildingSync schema can be used to create and validate XML files.
