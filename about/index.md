BuildingSync® is a standardized language for commercial 
building energy audit data that software developers can use to exchange 
data between audit tools. Taking the form of an 
[XML schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Schema_(W3C)), 
BuildingSync can be required by building owners and audit program 
managers to allow data analysis and aggregation across multiple 
buildings in order to evaluate program performance and analyze trends.

BuildingSync was developed using the standard energy data terminology 
defined in the [Building Energy Data Exchange Specification (BEDES)](https://bedes.lbl.gov/). 
BuildingSync is one of the first implementations of BEDES Version 1.0, 
and it was developed in close collaboration with the BEDES working 
groups.

BuildingSync standardizes the format of the energy audit data itself. 
It is not intended to standardize the calculations performed on these 
data by engineers, analysts, software packages, or other audit tools.

BuildingSync consists of two files and a reference sheet, which are all
offered as [free downloads](https://github.com/BuildingSync/schema/releases):

- The data field "dictionary" {% comment %}TODO: hyperlink to download 
location{% endcomment %} in Excel format, including field names, 
definitions, units, and other attributes. The data dictionary is aligned 
with BEDES, but includes only the subset of data fields that are 
relevant for energy audits. This file can be referenced to help 
standardize the terminology used in energy audits, but does it does not 
provide a structure that allows data to be exchanged across different 
applications.
- An XML Schema file (.xsd) {% comment %}TODO: hyperlink to download 
location{% endcomment %} that documents the relationships among the data 
fields. This file can be referenced as a voluntary or mandatory
reporting format for audit data, and data files compliant with the 
schema can then be aggregated and analyzed in a database. There are 
several tools available for viewing a graphical version of the XML 
schema file. View the 
[Wikipedia page about XML schema editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Schema_Editor#XML_Schema_Editors) 
for more information about XML viewers.
- The BuildingSync Geometry Reference Sheet {% comment %}TODO: hyperlink 
to download location{% endcomment %}, which illustrates how most of the 
simplified geometric terms (shapes, side names, vertices, orientations) 
are defined in the context of BuildingSync.

##### Why was BuildingSync developed?
Currently the energy audit industry lacks a common data collection 
format. Data collection differs widely between energy auditors, as do 
the outputs from various energy audit software tools. This makes it 
difficult to aggregate the data collected by different auditors, or to 
make comparisons between buildings that have been audited by different 
auditors using different software.

Energy audits of commercial buildings are becoming increasingly common, 
and even required, in the federal sector and in cities like New York 
City and San Francisco. The [American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE)](https://www.ashrae.org/) 
is in the process of developing a national standard for commercial 
building energy audits; however, this process is complicated by the 
lack of a standard data specification for information collected and 
reported, as well as the lack of consistency in data formats across 
audit software applications.

##### What can BuildingSync do?
BuildingSync can facilitate a consistent history of energy audit data 
across the life of a building or a group of buildings, and thus enable 
lower costs and higher energy performance results. It can also allow 
easier aggregation and analysis of audits conducted by different 
companies using different software. BuildingSync covers the essential 
data collected across all ASHRAE Audit Levels as defined in Procedures
for Commercial Building Energy Audits, and includes all data necessary 
for the calculation of a [Commercial Building Energy Asset Score](http://energy.gov/eere/buildings/commercial-building-energy-asset-score).

BuildingSync provides a common schema for energy audit data that can be
utilized by a variety of software and databases. Using the schema 
ensures that data collected for a single building over time is 
consistent and comparable, that data from different buildings can be 
easily aggregated and compared for large-scale analysis, and that data 
can be transferred between a variety of software tools. This streamlines 
the energy audit process and lead to new opportunities for using the 
resulting data to achieve greater energy efficiency.

By delivering energy audit data in a common format, energy auditors can
make it easier for their customers to use the data to make decisions.
For large building owners with many properties, standardized data across 
their buildings can help them more easily understand their opportunities 
for energy efficiency. Standardized data can also make it much easier 
for building owners to integrate the information they receive in an 
energy audit into property management tools for later reference and 
reuse.  Utilities or local governments that run energy audit programs 
may also find it easier to utilize the results of energy audits to spur
energy efficiency improvements if those results are in a common format.

The schema was built using the standard terminology defined in the 
Building Energy Data Exchange Specification (BEDES) dictionary. Existing
data formats and guidance about how to conduct energy audits were 
incorporated whenever possible, making it easier to reconcile and map 
data from existing databases to BuildingSync.

##### Who should use BuildingSync?
BuildingSync considers the needs and interests of all stakeholders in 
the energy audit industry, including building owners, auditors, software 
developers, and program managers. Existing data formats and datasets 
were leveraged whenever possible, to avoid duplication of effort and 
minimize the effort required to perform data reconciliation and mapping
from existing databases. Using BuildingSync, audit data can be collected 
and reported in a format that allows many different users to analyze and 
process the data to answer their specific questions.

- **Providers of building energy assessment software** can integrate the 
ability to export BuildingSync-compatible files into their software.
- **Providers of energy auditing services** can choose to use software 
that can output BuildingSync-compatible files.
- **Building owners** may wish to incorporate BuildingSync into their 
next RFP for a building energy audit by requiring the auditor to provide 
data in a BuildingSync-compatible format.
- **Utilities** can choose to recommend or require software that uses 
BuildingSync-compatible files for any programs involving energy audits.
